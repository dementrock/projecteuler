Did this problem by hand:
Let the fraction right before 3/7 be p/q, then they should satisfy:
3q - 7p = 1
The general solution to this equation is
p = 3k + 2, q = 7k + 5
So the fraction is (3k+2)/(7k+5)
This fraction should be as close to 3/7 as possible, so k should be the integer
as large as possible under the constraint 7k+5 <= 1000000, from which we get
k = 142856, and the answer follows
